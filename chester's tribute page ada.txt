      <h1><strong>A TIMELINE OF CHAZY CHAZ'S LIFE</strong></h1>
      <p>Chester Charles Bennington was born on March 20, 1976, in Phoenix, Arizona. His mother was a nurse, while his father was a police detective who worked on child sexual abuse cases</p>
      <p>Bennington first began singing with a band called Sean Dowdell and His Friends? They released an eponymous three-track cassette in 1993. Later, Dowdell and Bennington moved on to form a new band, Grey Daze, a post-grunge band from Phoenix, Arizona. The band recorded three albums: Demo in 1993, Wake/Me in 1994, and ...no sun today in 1997. Bennington left Grey Daze in 1998, but struggled to find another band.</p>
      <p>Bennington was frustrated and almost ready to quit his musical career altogether when Jeff Blue, the vice president of artists and repertoire at Zomba Music in Los Angeles, offered him an audition with the future members of Linkin Park.[13] Bennington quit his day job at a digital services firm[6] and took his family to California, where he had a successful audition with Linkin Park, who were then called Xero.Bennington primarily served as Linkin Park's lead vocalist, but occasionally shared the role with Shinoda. All Music Guide described Bennington's vocals as "higher-pitched" and "emotional", in contrast to Shinoda's hip-hop-style delivery.[7] Both members also worked together to write lyrics for the band's songs.</p>
      <p>Bennington had a child, Jaime (born May 12, 1996), from his relationship with Elka Brand.In 2006, he adopted Brand's other son, Isaiah[23] (born November 8, 1997). He married his first wife, Samantha Marie Olit, on October 31, 1996.They had one child together, Draven Sebastian (born April 19, 2002). Bennington's relationship with his first wife declined during his early years with Linkin Park, and they divorced in 2005. In 2006, he married Talinda Ann Bentley, a former Playboy model with whom he had three children: Tyler Lee Bennington (born March 16, 2006) and twins Lilly and Lila (born November 6, 2011).</p>
      <p>Bennington was plagued with poor health during the making of <strong>Meteora</strong>, and struggled to attend some of the album's recording sessions. In the summer of 2003, he began to suffer from extreme abdominal pain and gastrointestinal issues while filming the music video for "Numb" in Prague. He was forced to return to the United States for surgery, and filmed the remainder of the music video in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California; his housekeeper discovered his body around 9:00 a.m. PDT on July 20, 2017.His death was ruled a suicide by hanging.</p>
